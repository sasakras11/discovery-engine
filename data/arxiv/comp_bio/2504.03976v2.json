  "title": "OLAF: An Open Life Science Analysis Framework for Conversational Bioinformatics Powered by Large Language Models",
  "summary": "OLAF (Open Life Science Analysis Framework) is an open-source platform that\nenables researchers to perform bioinformatics analyses using natural language.\nBy combining large language models (LLMs) with a modular agent-pipe-router\narchitecture, OLAF generates and executes bioinformatics code on real\nscientific data, including formats like .h5ad. The system includes an Angular\nfront end and a Python/Firebase backend, allowing users to run analyses such as\nsingle-cell RNA-seq workflows, gene annotation, and data visualization through\na simple web interface. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, OLAF integrates code\nexecution, data handling, and scientific libraries in a reproducible,\nuser-friendly environment. It is designed to lower the barrier to computational\nbiology for non-programmers and support transparent, AI-powered life science\nresearch.",
