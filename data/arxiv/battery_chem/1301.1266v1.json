  "title": "Flexible fiber batteries for applications in smart textiles",
  "summary": "Here we discuss two alternative approaches for building flexible batteries\nfor applications in smart textiles. The first approach uses well-studied\ninorganic electrochemistry (Al-NaOCl galvanic cell) and innovative packaging in\norder to produce batteries in a slender and flexible fiber form that can be\nfurther weaved directly into the textiles. During fabrication process the\nbattery electrodes are co-drawn within a microstructured polymer fiber, which\nis later filled with liquid electrolyte. The second approach describes Li-ion\nchemistry within solid polymer electrolytes that are used to build a fully\nsolid and soft rechargeable battery that can be furthermore stitched onto a\ntextile, or integrated as stripes during weaving process.",
